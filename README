JWireReplay will parse the .pcap file format (created with tcpdump), analyse each and every TCP/IP packet within that captured file, organize each full HTTP request according to a specified sessionID (jsessionid for Java apps). After a .pcap file is imported JWireReplay will be able to replay that exact TCP/IP traffic to a specifies remote host. JWireReplay will also be able to play back the imported packets faster than originally captures. 

The objective is to both be able to analyze tough and hidden bugs that appear in your production environment, as well as being able to replay that same traffic to a test environment both for further analysis and for verifying that the bug has been successfully squashed. It is also possible to load-test your test environment using <b>Real HTTP traffic as captured from your production environment</b> in a reliable, repeatable manner. 

The project is currently in very early alpha.
